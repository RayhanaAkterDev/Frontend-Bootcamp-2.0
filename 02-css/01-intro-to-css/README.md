## My understanding

CSS can be added to HTML in three ways:

- inline (directly in an element),
- internal (within a `<style>` tag in the `<head>`), and
- external (linked `.css` file). 

Each method has its purpose—inline for quick fixes, internal for small-page styles, and external for full project styling. Using external CSS is the most efficient and maintainable approach.

> - It’s best practice to keep CSS separate for clean code and reusability.
