# CSS Units and Measurements

> Tags: css-units, css-measurements  
> _Purpose:_ Understand and practice different CSS units to control sizing, spacing, and responsiveness in layouts.

## My understanding

- Units in CSS define sizes for width, height, padding, margin, font-size, etc.
- There are two main categories:
  - **Absolute units**: fixed size regardless of other elements (e.g., px).
  - **Relative units**: sizes relative to other elements or viewport (e.g., %, em, rem, vw, vh).
- Using relative units improves flexibility and responsiveness of designs.

## 🔍 Key Tags & Purpose

- `px` → Pixel, fixed absolute size.
- `%` → Percentage, relative to parent container’s size.
- `em` → Relative to the current element’s font size.
- `rem` → Relative to the root (html) font size.
- `vw` / `vh` → Viewport width / height percentages.
- `auto` → Let the browser decide size based on content or context.

> - Use relative units like `%`, `em`, and `rem` for adaptable designs.
> - Viewport units (`vw`, `vh`) are handy for full-screen or fluid layouts.
