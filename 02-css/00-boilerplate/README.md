## My understanding

- A boilerplate is a reusable starter template that helps maintain consistency across different folders in the root directory.
- It usually contains a basic HTML structure, reset styles, and linked external stylesheets.
- Using a boilerplate saves time and ensures all files begin with a clean, organized setup.

> - Always use the `reset.css` file to ensure consistent default styles across browsers.  
> - Include it before your main stylesheet.
> - CSS can be included using either a relative or root-based path:
>   - Relative path: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="../../reset.css" />`
>   - Root path: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/02-css/reset.css" />`
