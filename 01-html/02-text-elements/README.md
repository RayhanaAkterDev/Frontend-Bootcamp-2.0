## My understanding

- HTML text elements help organize, format, and give semantic meaning to page content.
- Most common text element tags:
  - `<h1>`â€“`<h6>` â†’ Headings (from most to least important).
  - `<p>` â†’ Paragraph block for general text.
  - `<strong>` â†’ Important content; renders bold and has semantic meaning.
  - `<em>` â†’ Emphasized content; renders italic and has semantic meaning.
  - `<b>` / `<i>` â†’ Bold / Italic (for visual styling only, **no semantic meaning**).
  - `<br>` â†’ Inserts a single line break.
  - `<hr>` â†’ Creates a horizontal line, typically used as a visual section divider.
