# Custom Data Attributes

> Tags: html-basics.  
> _Purpose:_ Understand and practice how to use custom data attributes (`data-*`) in HTML to store extra information on elements, and how they can be accessed with JavaScript.

## My understanding

- Custom data attributes start with `data-` and allow storing extra information on HTML elements.
- They don't affect the HTML layout or appearance but can be used by JavaScript for dynamic behavior.
- Accessing them in JavaScript is done via the `.dataset` property.

> _Custom data attributes are useful for adding metadata to elements without cluttering the markup. They should not be used for storing sensitive data. Always use valid attribute names after `data-`._
