# HTML Entities

> Tags: html-basics  
> _Purpose:_ Show reserved or special characters correctly in HTML.

## My understanding

- Some characters can't be written directly in HTML.
- Use entities to show these characters safely.
- There are two types: named (e.g. `&copy;`) and numeric (e.g. `&#169;`).
- `&nbsp;` keeps words from breaking into new lines.

> - Use entities for symbols like `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`.
> - Example: `&lt;` → `<`, `&gt;` → `>`, `&amp;` → `&`
> - `&copy;` shows ©, `&euro;` shows €
> - `&nbsp;` keeps words stuck together like: This&nbsp;is&nbsp;one&nbsp;line
