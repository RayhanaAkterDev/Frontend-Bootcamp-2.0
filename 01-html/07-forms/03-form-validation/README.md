# Form Validation (HTML Only)

> Tags: html-forms, form-validation  
> _Purpose:_ Learn how to use native HTML5 form validation attributes to ensure user input meets required criteria before submission.

## My Understanding

HTML5 provides built-in form validation attributes that help validate user inputs on the client side without JavaScript. These validations improve user experience by giving instant feedback and preventing incorrect form submissions.

### Key Validation Attributes

- `required` → Ensures the input must be filled before submission.  
- `pattern` → Defines a regular expression the input value must match.  
- `min` and `max` → Set numeric or date range limits.  
- `minlength` and `maxlength` → Control the allowed length of text inputs.  
- `type` → Specific input types like `email`, `url`, `number`, etc., provide automatic format validation.  
- `title` → Provides custom error messages or guidance when validation fails.

> _Note_: Use `novalidate` on the `<form>` element to disable native validation if custom validation is preferred.
