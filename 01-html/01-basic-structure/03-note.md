## My understanding

- The word **HTML** stands for _hypertext markup language_, which is not a programming language but a markup language used to define the structure of the webpage.
- `<!DOCTYPE html>` declares that the document is an HTML5 document. It defines the version of HTML used.
- `<html>` is the root element of the webpage; all other tags are nested inside it.
- `<html lang="en">` sets the page language to English.
- `<head>` contains metadata about the document, such as the page title and links to external resources.
- `<meta>` tags serve various purposes, for example:

> - `<meta charset="UTF-8">` ensures proper character encoding and display.  
> - `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` enables responsive design for mobile devices.  
> - `<meta name="description" content="Template page demonstrating HTML5 basic structure.">` helps with SEO (search engine optimization) and improves accessibility.  
> - `<meta name="author" content="Rayhana Akter Sumaya">` specifies the name of the documentâ€™s author.  
> - `<meta name="keywords" content="HTML, meta tags, basic structure">` provides a list of keywords for search engines (largely outdated and ignored today).

- `<title>` defines the title of the webpage, shown on the browser tab.
- `<body>` contains the content that is visible to users.
